# ESP8266_WOTADNS_ArduinoOTA_Wrapper
 A wrapper library to simplify Wi-fi, Over The Air and mDNS implementation...

Although the implementation of both ArduinoOTA and ESP8266mDNS is fairly straightforward when using the ESP8266 Core within the Arduino IDE, I saw a simple way to make their implementation a little simpler by using a wrapper library.

WOTADNS is the end result and it makes life a little easier and reduces clutter in sketches.
