# ESP8266_WOTADNS_ArduinoOTA_Wrapper
 A wrapper library to simplify **W**i-fi, **O**ver **T**he **A**ir and m**DNS** implementation...

Although the implementation of both ArduinoOTA and ESP8266mDNS is fairly straightforward when using the ESP8266 Core within the Arduino IDE, a lot of space is taken up with code in sketches.

**WOTADNS** is the end result and it makes life a little easier and reduces clutter in sketches.

Details of the various methods of the **WOTADNS** class are given in 'WOTADNS.h'

A macros is included:

**DISABLE_WIFI**

This macro allows the ESP8266 to be used without Wi-fi
